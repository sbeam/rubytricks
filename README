Learning Ruby

Do I know what I know, or do I not know what I don't know?

This is an implementation of great idea to get in the habit of running tests,
while learning Ruby. Each time I learn a new ruby-ism, I try to make a 'test'
to demonstrate it. Not really testing Ruby, but testing my own knowledge and
understanding, while re-enforcing the lesson.

And on the off chance that Ruby 2.0 breaks something I have learned to be true,
will be a great way to find out before getting bitten by it in the field.
